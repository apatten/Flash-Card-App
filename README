= Flash Card App
Simple app that was born out of my need for an easy way to remember and learn common Swedish phrases I heard from friends. Also, a good excuse to stay current with current web trends and create a mobile site. Currently transitioning the site from a single purpose flash cards to generic flash cards that multiple users can use. 

== TODO

* add users and authentication
* switch view/hide order
* add mobile gestures support
* add keyboard navigation for regular web
